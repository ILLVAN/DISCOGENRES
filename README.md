# DISCOGENRES
A small scraper to pull all genres including number of releases from Discogs

You need to install BeatifulSoup from https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/ and pandas from https://pypi.org/project/pandas/.
Running the script will scrape discogs.com and then create a .csv and a .html file which contain all listed genres on Discogs including the amount of releases, the parent genre as well as a genre description, if available. I needed this information and I think it might be useful for other musicians / label owners too.
